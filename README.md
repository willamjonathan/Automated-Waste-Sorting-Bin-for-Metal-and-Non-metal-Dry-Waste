## Background
The Automated Waste Sorting Bin for Metal and Non-metal Dry Waste that we are making is specifically designed for separating metal and non-metal dry waste. We have incorporated the use of several sensors. One of them is the inductive proximity sensors for recognizing and sorting metal and non-metal items. Additionally, we have included an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of objects and servo motors to facilitate the rotation of trash compartments and coin dispensing. To support such machinery, designing and creating a shell case for the hardware is also necessary, to which we decided to use infra boards. Metal wiring will also be added to some parts of the casing for better functionality, such as for the coin dispenser and rotational trash sorting apparatus.
